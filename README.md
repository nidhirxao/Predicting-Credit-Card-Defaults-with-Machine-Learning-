# Predicting-Credit-Card-Defaults-with-Machine-Learning-
Credit Card Default Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook project focused on predicting credit card default payments using various machine learning methods. The project explores data analysis, visualization, and five different machine learning techniques to predict defaults.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information on credit card holders, including features such as gender, education, marriage status, and age, as well as payment history, bill amounts, and payment amounts.

Machine Learning Methods
Logistic Regression (LR): A logistic regression model was applied to predict default payments based on selected features. The accuracy achieved was approximately 77.5%.

Random Forest Classifier (RFC): A random forest classifier was implemented, resulting in an accuracy of around 81.7%.

Decision Tree Classifier (DTC): A decision tree classifier was used, with an accuracy of approximately 72.1%.

Lasso Regression (L): Lasso regression was employed, achieving a root mean square error (RMS) value of 0.173 and an accuracy of approximately 82.7%.

Ridge Regression (R): Ridge regression yielded a similar RMS value of 0.172 and an accuracy of around 82.8%.

Visualization
The project includes visualizations, such as histograms and count plots, to better understand the data distribution and the proportion of default payments.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of credit card default prediction using various machine learning methods. It serves as a valuable reference for those interested in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook for detailed code and analysis.
